          <h2>About The Album</h2>
          <p>
            Liquid Skin has a complete and cohesive feel that is timeless. If you knew nothing of
            this record or this band you'd struggle to place it on a time-line or even give it a
            country of origin.
          </p>

              Even though the band had moved on from the four-track recordings that brought them
              their initial success they still wanted to retain some of those "low-key" elements on
              the new record. The musical maturity and ease with which the band transferred their
              skills to the studio environment is quite astonishingly displayed on 'Liquid Skin'.
            </p>

            <p>
              'Bring It On' is one of the stunning testaments to that train of thought. The
              laid-back, soulful, rasping vocal, funky breakdown and irresistible hook make it an
              album highlight then and now. Ian Ball says that he wanted to make the album as "wild"
              and "varied" as possible, "something that was a studio smorgasbord". He says "We'd
              sample everything we could" and when you listen back to 'Liquid Skin' twenty years on
              you can't help but be blown way by its sound.
            </p>

            <p>
              The smooth layered vocals on the Paris inspired 'We Haven't Turned Around', the
              seasick song with Tom's Pixies vocal 'Fill My Cup', and the reflective post break-up
              trauma of 'Rosalita' display the variety and creativity that is found throughout the
              album.
            </p>

            <p>
              The close-out track to the original album, 'Devil Will Ride', is where the band did
              not hold back, throwing everything into the vocoder enhanced mix including backing
              vocals, orchestration and brass just for good measure. The 7m epic remains a
              triumphant end to a cracking album.
            </p>
